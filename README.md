Relay client for simple persons (like me)

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/relei.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/relei)

**OBS! OBS! This is project is in a proof-of-concept stage so I don't promise that
things are working yet!!**

## Motivation

I started to look at the Facebook's [Relay](https://facebook.github.io/relay/)
and its examples. I understood nothing. So many confusing things like routes,
queries, fragments, root containers, containers...

The core idea of Relay is simple - client declares what data it likes and the
Relay abstracts the rest. Let's keep it in that way!
